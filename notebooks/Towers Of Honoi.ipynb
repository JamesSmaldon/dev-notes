    "The Tower of Hanoi\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    " - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.\n",
    " - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    " \n",
    "With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n - 1, where n is the number of disks."
