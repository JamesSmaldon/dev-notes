    "|Price|Sale price stated on the transfer deed.||\n",
    "|Date of Transfer|Date when the sale was completed, as stated on the transfer deed.||\n",
    "|Postcode|This is the postcode used at the time of the original transaction. Note that postcodes can be reallocated and these changes are not reflected in the Price Paid Dataset.||\n",
    "|Property Type|D = Detached, S = Semi-Detached, T = Terraced, F = Flats/Maisonettes, O = Other ||\n",
    "|OldNew|Indicates the age of the property and applies to all price paid transactions, residential and non-residential. Y = a newly built property, N = an established residential building||\n",
    "|Duration|Relates to the tenure: F = Freehold, L= Leasehold etc.||\n",
    "|PAON|Primary Addressable Object Name. If there is a sub-building for example the building is divided into flats, see Secondary Addressable Object Name (SAON).|Store addresses in a single text column, as we have postcode which is more useful.|\n",

B = Additional Price Paid entry including transfers under a power of sale/repossessions, buy-to-lets (where they can be identified by a Mortgage) and transfers to non-private individuals.||\n",

    "### Notes on Inputing the Data\n",
    "* Each record has a GUID as an identifier, we probably don't need to use these as the primary key in the database, instead we can just create an auto incrementing int based column. GUIDs are useful in some situations (e.g. if you need to generate the record outside of the database and add it afterwards)  but they have performance implications, as they do not index well. Therefore, I'll dump the GUIDs and just use the serial data type to add unique ids on insertion.\n",
