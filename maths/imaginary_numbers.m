# i is a transformation that when applied twice, turns 1 into -1
# It can be visualised as a rotation of 90 degrees.

# rotates 90 degrees into the complex dimension
1*i
# two 90 degree rotations rotates back into the 
# real number plain (-1)
1*i*i
# -i is a negative (i.e. clockwise) rotation, so
# we can also rotate to -1 with:
-i*-i
# A number can have real and imaginary parts. Which 
# defines a triangle.
2 + 3i
# Multiplying by a complex number rotates by its angle.

# i is equiv to e^(i*pi/2) because we need to grow from 
# 1 at a rate of pi/2 *i to create a 90 degree rotation.
e ^ (i*pi/2)
